# Meeting Viewer and Event Generator

I am "actively involved in the interview process". While doing so I found it difficult to view the planned week's, month's events, meetings and calls on the same page of Google Calendar . I had to swipe through dates and months to get an overview of all the events I have lined up. I then created a very simple and easy-to-use "Event Viewer and Creator" using HTML5 , JavaScript , SCSS , Semantic UI Framework and Google Calendar API.

#Key Feature

  * Uses Google Calendar API to retrieve events from a specific date range
  * View events and its details in clean UI
  *  Create new event for oneself quickly with minimal details.
  * View the new event it on any device / google map
